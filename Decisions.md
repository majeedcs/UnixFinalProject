The first choice that we had to make is to choose which web hosting service that we will use. We are looking at three different options: AWS, Gratis VPS, and Digital Ocean.

AWS:
Amazon Lightsail:

PROS:
Very user friendly UI.
They have many options for picking linux OS for the servers and you have options with os plus applications.
Very easy to follow setup and launch an instance.
No ads.
Lots of options.
On google it says Lightsail is cheaper than EC2.
The AI overview when I googled "difference between ec2 and lightsail" says: 
"Lightsail is a simpler, easier-to-use platform, ideal for beginners or those with straightforward needs." 
This is very beneficial to us since it is our first time using these services. So a simpler more user friendly platform would help us.
Our needs are not very complicated since all we need to do is host a website on a VPS.

CONS:
They have a free version available for 3 months 750 hours a month limit. A lot less than the 12 months that you get from EC2.

Amazon EC2:

PROS:
They have a free version available for 12 months.
Very user friendly UI.
They have many options for picking linux OS for the server such as (Amazon linux, macOS, Ubuntu, Windows, Red Hat, SUSE Linux, Debian).
No ads.
Lots of options.
CONS:
Not as easy to follow setup and launch an instance when compared to amazon Lightsail.
On google it says Lightsail is cheaper than EC2.
The AI overview when I googled "difference between ec2 and lightsail" says: 
EC2 offers greater flexibility, control, and a wider range of instance types, making it suitable for more complex or demanding workloads. 
This is a con for us because in this case we are the beginners and do not need the extra flexibility and control that the EC2 offers.

Gratis VPS:
PROS:
It is completely free and is a useful tool for business that are small to medium scale.
CONS:
-The Free VPS is intended for educational, developmental, and testing purposes only, so if you are looking for a free VPS as a business you will not be able to use this.
-Very sketchy, might be a scam, tried starting the vps and I got some pop ups that made seem like it was a scam.
We will not be using this product. Very inconvient to use.
We do not even know if the payed elements work.

After trying out these various options the simplest one to use is Amazon lightsail. We will definetly not use Gratis VPS since it might work however it looks sketchy,
and it is possible that it works however there is so many complication it is not even worth using when Amazon has free trials that suit our needs for the project.
Both the 3 month Lightsail, and the 12 month EC2 is more than a long enough duration to meet our needs. We are more likely to select Amazon lightsail, 
since it is beginner friendly and easier to use then EC2. However we might try out EC2 to see the difference between the two then we will determine which one we like
more. Lastly we can say that from how it looks now considering the simple needs of our project and us being beginners we are more likely to favour Amazon Lightsail.

Choice 2 is picking a domain using Lightsail, not sure about EC2 yet.
Choice 3 is a webserver, NGINX Apache.
