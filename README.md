# Unix Project - VPS Website with Automatic GitHub Updates
## Overview
Project Description: We will set up a VPS to host a website that automatically updates when we change the code on GitHub. Our project will build a secure and reliable environment by setting up a key-based SSH login and managing the servers through our VPS. We will also automate the deployment and update the website directly from GitHub to the server.
